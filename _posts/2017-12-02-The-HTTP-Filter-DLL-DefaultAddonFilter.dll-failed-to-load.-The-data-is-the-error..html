Today, I had this error on my Dynamics CRM server and tried solution in this link (http://ms-crm-2011-beta.blogspot.com/2011/09/could-not-load-all-isapi-filters-for.html) but the error still existed. Maybe this is not my situation.<br />Then I opened "Uninstall or change a program" of Windows and recognized that the library "<b>Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable(x64)</b>" was missing. So I downloaded it from Microsoft download website and installed it. And it fixed the error.
